Semantic search and its recent applications enabled search engines to organize their wealth of information around entities. Entity linking and retrieval provide the building stones for organizing the web of entities. This tutorial aims to cover all facets of semantic search from a unified point of view and connect real-world applications with results from scientific publications. We provide a comprehensive overview of entity linking and retrieval in the context of semantic search and thoroughly explore techniques for query understanding, entity-based retrieval and ranking on unstructured text, structured knowledge repositories, and a mixture of these. We point out the connections between published approaches and applications, and provide hands-on examples on real-world use cases and datasets.},

abstract = {In this paper we present a multimodal approach to categorizing user posts based on their discussion topic. To integrate heterogeneous information extracted from the posts, i.e. text, visual content and the information about user interactions with the online platform, we deploy graph convolutional networks that were recently proven effective in classification tasks on knowledge graphs. As the case study we use the analysis of violent online political extremism content, a challenging task due to a particularly high semantic level at which extremist ideas are discussed. Here we demonstrate the potential of using neural networks on graphs for classifying multimedia content and, perhaps more importantly, the effectiveness of multimedia analysis techniques in aiding the domain experts performing qualitative data analysis. Our conclusions are supported by extensive experiments on a large collection of extremist posts.},

Evolved from the previous research on artificial neural networks, this technology has shown superior performance to other machine learning algorithms in areas such as image and voice recognition, natural language processing, among others. The first wave of applications of deep learning in pharmaceutical research has emerged in recent years, and its utility has gone beyond bioactivity predictions and has shown promise in addressing diverse problems in drug discovery. Examples will be discussed covering bioactivity prediction, de novo molecular design, synthesis prediction and biological image analysis.}

   abstract = {Cancer is a major threat to the lives of human beings. Around 74% of the people who get affected by cancer lost their lives. But early detection of cancer cells can prevent death rates. CT(Computerized Tomography) is one of the major used for cancer cell identifications by the oncologist. Computer-aided cancer detection plays a major role in the detection of cancer in an early stage. Classification of CT scan images comes as the first stage for computer-aided detection of cancer cells. CNN(Convolution Neural Network) based classification method along with Gaussian Filtering and Watershed Segmentation is proposed for effective classification of CT Scan Images.500 CT Scan images of Bone, Brain, Lung, Kidney, Neck are collected from the Oncology Department, Manipal Hospitals, Vijayawada. The accuracy rate of 94.5% is achieved with the proposed CNN based classification CT Scan images.},

With the experiments performed on the natural scenes with different noises, we came on a conclusion that Gaussian blur filter perform better with respect to the bilateral filter. This paper also decides the range of noises which the user can tolerate while dealing with the image. The experiment is conducted on three natural scenes with the help of graph based image segmentation technique and result is validated using correlation.},

abstract = {Along with the explosive growth of the World Wide Web, an immense industry for the production and consumption of pornography has grown. Though the censorship and legal restraints on pornography are discriminating in different historical, cultural and national contexts, selling pornography to minors is not allowed in most cases. Detecting human skin tone is of utmost importance in pornography image filtering algorithms. In this paper, we propose two patch-based skin color detection algorithms: regular patch and irregular patch skin color detection algorithms. On the basis of skin detection, we extract 31-dimensional features from the input image, and these features are fed into a random forest classifier. Our algorithm has been incorporated into an adult-content filtering infrastructure, and is now in active use for preventing minors from accessing pornographic images via mobile phones.},

Since no universal data format is in widespread use for these images today, each vendor defines its own proprietary data formats, analysis tools, viewers and software libraries. This creates issues not only for pathologists, but also for interoperability. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of OpenSlide, a vendor-neutral C library for reading and manipulating digital slides of diverse vendor formats. The library is extensible and easily interfaced to various programming languages. An application written to the OpenSlide interface can transparently handle multiple vendor formats. OpenSlide is in use today by many academic and industrial organizations world-wide, including many research sites in the United States that are funded by the National Institutes of Health.}

abstract = {In this paper we present a multimodal approach to categorizing user posts based on their discussion topic. To integrate heterogeneous information extracted from the posts, i.e. text, visual content and the information about user interactions with the online platform, we deploy graph convolutional networks that were recently proven effective in classification tasks on knowledge graphs. As the case study we use the analysis of violent online political extremism content, a challenging task due to a particularly high semantic level at which extremist ideas are discussed. Here we demonstrate the potential of using neural networks on graphs for classifying multimedia content and, perhaps more importantly, the effectiveness of multimedia analysis techniques in aiding the domain experts performing qualitative data analysis. Our conclusions are supported by extensive experiments on a large collection of extremist posts.},

abstract = {Over the past decade, deep learning has achieved remarkable success in various artificial intelligence research areas. Evolved from the previous research on artificial neural networks, this technology has shown superior performance to other machine learning algorithms in areas such as image and voice recognition, natural language processing, among others. The first wave of applications of deep learning in pharmaceutical research has emerged in recent years, and its utility has gone beyond bioactivity predictions and has shown promise in addressing diverse problems in drug discovery. Examples will be discussed covering bioactivity prediction, de novo molecular design, synthesis prediction and biological image analysis.}
